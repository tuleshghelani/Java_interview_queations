# Java Interview Questions (Basic Level)

## 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).

## 2. What are the main features of Java?
- Object-Oriented
- Platform Independent
- Simple and Familiar Syntax
- Robust and Secure
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic

## 3. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Enables a computer to run Java programs
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Contains JVM and libraries to run Java applications
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Contains JRE plus development tools like compiler and debugger

## 4. What is the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types in Java?
Primitive data types (int, boolean, char, etc.) are predefined, store simple values, and aren't objects. Non-primitive data types (String, Array, Class, etc.) are derived from classes and store references to objects.

## 5. What is a class and an object in Java?
A class is a blueprint/template that describes the behavior/state of objects. An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with state and behavior.

## 6. What are the different access modifiers in Java?
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
- **default (no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class

## 7. What is method overloading in Java?
Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of parameters).

## 8. What are constructors in Java?
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when an object is created using the 'new' keyword.

## 9. What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' in Java?
'==' operator compares references (memory addresses) of objects, while '.equals()' method compares the content/values of objects.

## 10. What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship.

## 11. What is method overriding in Java?
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class. It's a key aspect of runtime polymorphism.

## 12. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?
An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface traditionally contains only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods). Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables; interfaces cannot have constructors and can only have constants. A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class.

## 13. What is polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. It's implemented through method overriding and method overloading, enabling the same method to perform different behaviors based on the object it's acting upon.

## 14. What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit, hiding the internal state of an object and requiring interaction through well-defined interfaces. It's implemented using private variables along with public getter and setter methods.

## 15. How does exception handling work in Java?
Exception handling in Java is managed through try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords. Code that might cause an exception is placed in a try block, potential exceptions are caught in catch blocks, and code that should always execute is placed in a finally block. Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared using the throws clause.

## 16. What are the main components of the Java Collections Framework?
The Java Collections Framework provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. Its main components include interfaces (List, Set, Queue, Map), implementation classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap), and algorithms for performing useful operations on collections.

## 17. What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java?
String objects are immutable, while StringBuilder and StringBuffer objects are mutable. StringBuffer is synchronized and thread-safe, making it suitable for multi-threaded programs, whereas StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it faster in single-threaded scenarios. For string manipulation tasks, StringBuilder is generally preferred over String concatenation.

## 18. How does multithreading work in Java?
Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum CPU utilization. It can be implemented by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Java provides built-in synchronization mechanisms to handle thread coordination and avoid issues like race conditions.

## 19. What are packages in Java and why are they important?
Packages in Java are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, preventing name conflicts and making code more maintainable. They provide access protection and remove naming collisions. The Java API itself is organized into different packages like java.lang, java.util, and java.io.

## 20. What is the difference between stack and heap memory in Java?
In Java, stack memory is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread. It contains primitive values and references to objects. Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation of Java objects and JRE classes. Objects created in the heap are globally accessible and have a lifetime until they're garbage collected.
