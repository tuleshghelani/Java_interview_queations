# Java Interview Questions (Basic Level)

## 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).

## 2. What are the main features of Java?
- Object-Oriented
- Platform Independent
- Simple and Familiar Syntax
- Robust and Secure
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic

## 3. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Enables a computer to run Java programs
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Contains JVM and libraries to run Java applications
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Contains JRE plus development tools like compiler and debugger

## 4. What is the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types in Java?
Primitive data types (int, boolean, char, etc.) are predefined, store simple values, and aren't objects. Non-primitive data types (String, Array, Class, etc.) are derived from classes and store references to objects.

## 5. What is a class and an object in Java?
A class is a blueprint/template that describes the behavior/state of objects. An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with state and behavior.

## 6. What are the different access modifiers in Java?
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
- **default (no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class

## 7. What is method overloading in Java?
Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of parameters).

## 8. What are constructors in Java?
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when an object is created using the 'new' keyword.

## 9. What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' in Java?
'==' operator compares references (memory addresses) of objects, while '.equals()' method compares the content/values of objects.

## 10. What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship.
