# Java Interview Questions (Basic Level)

## 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It's a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).

## 2. What are the main features of Java?
- Object-Oriented
- Platform Independent
- Simple and Familiar Syntax
- Robust and Secure
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic

## 3. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Enables a computer to run Java programs
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Contains JVM and libraries to run Java applications
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Contains JRE plus development tools like compiler and debugger

## 4. What is the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types in Java?
Primitive data types (int, boolean, char, etc.) are predefined, store simple values, and aren't objects. Non-primitive data types (String, Array, Class, etc.) are derived from classes and store references to objects.

## 5. What is a class and an object in Java?
A class is a blueprint/template that describes the behavior/state of objects. An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with state and behavior.

## 6. What are the different access modifiers in Java?
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
- **default (no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class

## 7. What is method overloading in Java?
Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of parameters).

## 8. What are constructors in Java?
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when an object is created using the 'new' keyword.

## 9. What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' in Java?
'==' operator compares references (memory addresses) of objects, while '.equals()' method compares the content/values of objects.

## 10. What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship.

## 11. What is method overriding in Java?
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class. It's a key aspect of runtime polymorphism.

## 12. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?
An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface traditionally contains only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods). Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables; interfaces cannot have constructors and can only have constants. A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class.

## 13. What is polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. It's implemented through method overriding and method overloading, enabling the same method to perform different behaviors based on the object it's acting upon.

## 14. What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit, hiding the internal state of an object and requiring interaction through well-defined interfaces. It's implemented using private variables along with public getter and setter methods.

## 15. How does exception handling work in Java?
Exception handling in Java is managed through try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords. Code that might cause an exception is placed in a try block, potential exceptions are caught in catch blocks, and code that should always execute is placed in a finally block. Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared using the throws clause.

## 16. What are the main components of the Java Collections Framework?
The Java Collections Framework provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. Its main components include interfaces (List, Set, Queue, Map), implementation classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap), and algorithms for performing useful operations on collections.

## 17. What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java?
String objects are immutable, while StringBuilder and StringBuffer objects are mutable. StringBuffer is synchronized and thread-safe, making it suitable for multi-threaded programs, whereas StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it faster in single-threaded scenarios. For string manipulation tasks, StringBuilder is generally preferred over String concatenation.

## 18. How does multithreading work in Java?
Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum CPU utilization. It can be implemented by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Java provides built-in synchronization mechanisms to handle thread coordination and avoid issues like race conditions.

## 19. What are packages in Java and why are they important?
Packages in Java are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, preventing name conflicts and making code more maintainable. They provide access protection and remove naming collisions. The Java API itself is organized into different packages like java.lang, java.util, and java.io.

## 20. What is the difference between stack and heap memory in Java?
In Java, stack memory is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread. It contains primitive values and references to objects. Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation of Java objects and JRE classes. Objects created in the heap are globally accessible and have a lifetime until they're garbage collected.

## 21. How does garbage collection work in Java?
Garbage collection is the automatic memory management process in Java that identifies and removes objects no longer needed by the application. The JVM's garbage collector identifies objects that are no longer referenced and reclaims their memory. While developers don't explicitly deallocate memory, they can suggest garbage collection using `System.gc()`, though this doesn't guarantee immediate execution.

## 22. What is the 'final' keyword in Java and how can it be used?
The 'final' keyword in Java can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. A final variable's value cannot be changed once assigned, a final method cannot be overridden in subclasses, and a final class cannot be extended. This keyword helps in creating constants, preventing method overriding, and ensuring class implementation security.

## 23. What is the 'static' keyword in Java?
The 'static' keyword in Java is used to create class-level elements that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. Static variables are shared among all instances, static methods can be called without creating an object, and static blocks are executed when the class is loaded. Static elements can be accessed directly through the class name.

## 24. What are the main types of Java I/O streams?
Java I/O streams are divided into byte streams and character streams. Byte streams (InputStream/OutputStream) handle raw binary data, while character streams (Reader/Writer) handle character data with encoding awareness. Additionally, there are specialized streams for different data types like DataInputStream, BufferedReader, and ObjectOutputStream.

## 25. What is autoboxing and unboxing in Java?
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper class objects (e.g., int to Integer). Unboxing is the reverse process, converting wrapper class objects to their primitive types. These features were introduced in Java 5 to make code cleaner when working with collections, which can only store objects, not primitives.

## 26. What are annotations in Java?
Annotations are a form of metadata that provide information about code but don't directly affect its execution. They can be applied to classes, methods, variables, parameters, and other program elements. Annotations can be used for compiler instructions, build-time processing, or runtime processing through reflection. Common built-in annotations include @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings.

## 27. What are generics in Java and why are they important?
Generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. They provide compile-time type safety by eliminating the risk of ClassCastException. Generics allow the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a "type parameter" specified by the user, making code more flexible, reusable, and type-safe.

## 28. What are enums in Java?
Enums in Java are special classes that represent a group of constants. They provide type-safety, can have fields, methods, and constructors, and can implement interfaces (but cannot extend classes). Each enum constant is an instance of the enum type. Enums are particularly useful for representing fixed sets of values like days of the week, card suits, or status codes.

## 29. What is the try-with-resources statement in Java?
The try-with-resources statement is a feature introduced in Java 7 for automatically closing resources that implement the AutoCloseable interface. Resources declared in the try statement's parentheses are automatically closed at the end of the block, regardless of whether an exception occurs. This eliminates the need for explicit finally blocks for resource cleanup, reducing code verbosity and potential resource leaks.

## 30. What are lambda expressions in Java?
Lambda expressions, introduced in Java 8, provide a clear and concise way to implement functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method). They enable treating functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions remove the verbosity of anonymous inner classes and enable functional programming aspects in Java through a compact syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements; }`.

## 31. What are Streams in Java?
Streams, introduced in Java 8, represent a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. They provide a high-level abstraction for processing data collections, allowing developers to express complex data processing queries in a functional style. Streams don't store data; they operate on a source (like collections) and produce a result without modifying the source. Key features include pipeline operations (filter, map, reduce), lazy evaluation, and parallel execution support.

## 32. What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java?
Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either caught (using try-catch) or declared (using throws) at compile time. They extend Exception but not RuntimeException and represent conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch. Examples include IOException and SQLException. Unchecked exceptions extend RuntimeException and don't need to be explicitly caught or declared. They typically represent programming errors like NullPointerException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException that shouldn't occur in properly written code.

## 33. What is the Java Memory Model (JMM)?
The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads interact through memory in a Java program. It specifies the legal transformations that a compiler can perform on code involving shared variables and ensures that properly synchronized programs exhibit predictable behavior across different hardware architectures. The JMM addresses issues like visibility (when one thread's changes become visible to other threads), atomicity (operations that execute as a single, indivisible unit), and ordering (the sequence in which operations appear to execute).

## 34. What are Java Annotations and how are they used?
Java Annotations are a form of metadata that provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. They have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate. Annotations can be used for various purposes: providing information to the compiler (@Override, @SuppressWarnings), compile-time and deployment-time processing (@Generated), or runtime processing (@Retention, @Documented). Custom annotations can be created using @interface and can be applied to classes, methods, fields, parameters, and other program elements.

## 35. What is Dependency Injection in Java?
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which objects receive their dependencies rather than creating them internally. It promotes loose coupling, improves testability, and enhances code maintainability. In Java, DI can be implemented manually or through frameworks like Spring. There are three main types: constructor injection (dependencies provided through constructors), setter injection (dependencies set through setter methods), and field injection (dependencies injected directly into fields, often using annotations like @Autowired in Spring).

## 36. How are equals() and hashCode() used to compare objects in Java?
The `equals()` method is used to compare the contents of two objects for logical equality, while `hashCode()` provides a hash representation of the object. For correct behavior in collections like HashMap and HashSet, both methods should be overridden to ensure that equal objects have the same hash code.

## 37. How do equals() and hashCode() affect object comparison in HashMap and HashSet?
In HashMap and HashSet, `hashCode()` determines the bucket location for storing objects, and `equals()` is used to check for actual equality within that bucket. If two objects are considered equal by `equals()`, they must have the same `hashCode()` for correct retrieval and uniqueness in these collections.
